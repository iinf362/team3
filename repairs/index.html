<li><h3>What are my basic rights and responsibilities of repair as a tenant?</h3><button> + </button>
	<div class= "info">

		<p>Tenants have a right to live in a property that is "habitable." This means the apartment should be free from danger. Any provision in a lease that waives this right is void, because a landlord must keep apartments in livable condition. However, if the tenant causes a sanitation or safety issue that requires repairs, a landlord is not responsible for the repairs required to make the property livable again.</p>
