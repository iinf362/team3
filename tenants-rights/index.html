<h2>Tenants' rights once in an apartment</h2>
<p>When a tenant and landlord agree to rent an apartment or home, that agreement is called a lease. Any agreement to rent out an apartment or home is considered a lease, and the lease does not have to be in writing. A tenant and landlord can simply make an oral agreement to rent out an apartment, and that agreement is called an oral lease. This section describes the basics about leases, and explains how the law interacts with the landlord-tenant relationship as reflected in the lease. Sometimes, the law requires the landlord to provide protections to tenants regardless of the agreement the tenant and landlord reach. In addition, sometimes the law forbids the landlord to impose certain requirements on tenants through the lease: in other words, it prohibits certain lease terms. This section will describe the law governing leases in New York State.</p>

If a landlord can prove that a particular building was constructed before April 18, 1929, and hot water was not originally installed or required at time of the construction of the building, he or she is not required to provide hot water to the tenants of such a building. This is a very narrow exception, however. In the overwhelming majority of apartments in New York State, the landlord is required to provide hot water to tenants. Multiple Dwelling Law § 75.
