<h2>Tenants' rights once in an apartment</h2>
<p>When a tenant and landlord agree to rent an apartment or home, that agreement is called a lease. Any agreement to rent out an apartment or home is considered a lease, and the lease does not have to be in writing. A tenant and landlord can simply make an oral agreement to rent out an apartment, and that agreement is called an oral lease. This section describes the basics about leases, and explains how the law interacts with the landlord-tenant relationship as reflected in the lease. Sometimes, the law requires the landlord to provide protections to tenants regardless of the agreement the tenant and landlord reach. In addition, sometimes the law forbids the landlord to impose certain requirements on tenants through the lease: in other words, it prohibits certain lease terms. This section will describe the law governing leases in New York State.</p>

<ul>

		<p>
			The landlord is required to keep every part of an apartment and the lot it is on in good repair. A property in good repair is clean and free from vermin, rodents, dirt, filth, garbage or other dangers to life or health. The tenant can also be liable to the landlord for the cost of a repair if the tenant or the tenant's guests caused the condition that required repair. Multiple Residence Law § 174; Multiple Dwelling Law §§ 78, 80.

	</li>


	<li>
		<button>Right to Hot Water</button>
		<p>
			Landlords are required to provide hot water to the tenant 24 hours a day, all year round. There is a limited exception to this requirement. If a landlord can prove that a particular building was constructed before April 18, 1929, and hot water was not originally installed or required at time of the construction of the building, he or she is not required to provide hot water to the tenants of such a building. This is a very narrow exception, however. In the overwhelming majority of apartments in New York State, the landlord is required to provide hot water to tenants. Multiple Dwelling Law § 75.

	</li>

	<li><button>Right to Heat or Heating Equipment/Facilities</button>
		<p>
			In apartments where the landlord supplies the heat or heating equipment, such equipment must be able to maintain indoor temperature of 68°F when the outdoor temperature is below 55°F between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., and indoor temperature of at least 55°F between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. when the outdoor is below 40°F, all during the months from the beginning of October through the end of May each year. Multiple Dwelling Law § 79; Multiple Residence Law § 173.

	</li>
	
	<li><button>Right to Smoke Detector</button>
		<p>
			All apartment buildings, whenever constructed, shall have in each apartment a functioning smoke detector that meets fire code requirements and that the tenant can check periodically for operation. Once a tenant occupies an apartment, the care and maintenance of the smoke detector becomes the tenant's responsibility, including replacement, except where the detector becomes inoperable within one year after installation due to no fault of the tenant. Multiple Dwelling Law § 68; Multiple Residence Law § 15.
