<h2>Tenants' rights once in an apartment</h2>
<p>When a tenant and landlord agree to rent an apartment or home, that agreement is called a lease. Any agreement to rent out an apartment or home is considered a lease, and the lease does not have to be in writing. A tenant and landlord can simply make an oral agreement to rent out an apartment, and that agreement is called an oral lease. This section describes the basics about leases, and explains how the law interacts with the landlord-tenant relationship as reflected in the lease. Sometimes, the law requires the landlord to provide protections to tenants regardless of the agreement the tenant and landlord reach. In addition, sometimes the law forbids the landlord to impose certain requirements on tenants through the lease: in other words, it prohibits certain lease terms. This section will describe the law governing leases in New York State.</p>

<h2>RIGHT TO LIVABLE PREMISES</h2>
<ul>

	<li .><h3>Right to an Apartment that is Suitable for Human Habitation</h3> <button> + </button>
		<p class="info" >
			In every lease the landlord promises that the apartment and common areas are maintained, and will be continue to be maintained, in a condition that is suitable for a tenant to live, free from conditions endangering or detrimental to life, health, or safety of occupants. tenant cannot waive or modify this right. Real Property Law § 235-b. See Part III: Right to Repairs.
		</p>

	</li>


	<li><h3>Right to Repairs and Clean Premises</h3><button> + </button>
		<p class="info" >
			The landlord is required to keep every part of an apartment and the lot it is on in good repair. A property in good repair is clean and free from vermin, rodents, dirt, filth, garbage or other dangers to life or health. The tenant can also be liable to the landlord for the cost of a repair if the tenant or the tenant's guests caused the condition that required repair. Multiple Residence Law § 174; Multiple Dwelling Law §§ 78, 80.
		</p>
	</li>


	<li>
		<h3>Right to Hot Water</h3><button> + </button>
		<p class="info" >
			Landlords are required to provide hot water to the tenant 24 hours a day, all year round. There is a limited exception to this requirement. If a landlord can prove that a particular building was constructed before April 18, 1929, and hot water was not originally installed or required at time of the construction of the building, he or she is not required to provide hot water to the tenants of such a building. This is a very narrow exception, however. In the overwhelming majority of apartments in New York State, the landlord is required to provide hot water to tenants. Multiple Dwelling Law § 75.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li><h3>Right to Heat or Heating Equipment/Facilities</h3><button> + </button>
		<p class="info" >
			In apartments where the landlord supplies the heat or heating equipment, such equipment must be able to maintain indoor temperature of 68°F when the outdoor temperature is below 55°F between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., and indoor temperature of at least 55°F between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. when the outdoor is below 40°F, all during the months from the beginning of October through the end of May each year. Multiple Dwelling Law § 79; Multiple Residence Law § 173.
		</p>
	</li>
	
	<li><h3>Right to Smoke Detector</h3><button> + </button>
		<p class="info" >
			All apartment buildings, whenever constructed, shall have in each apartment a functioning smoke detector that meets fire code requirements and that the tenant can check periodically for operation. Once a tenant occupies an apartment, the care and maintenance of the smoke detector becomes the tenant's responsibility, including replacement, except where the detector becomes inoperable within one year after installation due to no fault of the tenant. Multiple Dwelling Law § 68; Multiple Residence Law § 15.
		</p>
	</li>

</ul>



<h2>RIGHT TO COMPLAIN AND ORGANIZE</h2>
<ul>
	<li><h3>Right to Be Protected against a Retaliatory Eviction</h3><button> + </button>

		<p>Landlords of apartments (unless owner-occupied with less than four units) cannot evict a tenant or substantially change the terms of a tenancy because of a tenant's good faith complaint to governmental authorities regarding the landlord's violations of a law pertaining to tenant health or safety, the tenant's actions to secure or enforce rights under a lease, or other state or federal laws regulating residential premises.
		<br>
		<br>	
        A landlord is also not allowed to commence eviction proceedings in retaliation for a tenant complaining to a government entity about the conditions in the apartment or for some illegal treatment by the tenant of the landlord. If a landlord is engaged in what is known as a "retaliatory eviction" a tenant can raise this as a defense in an eviction proceeding (except for an eviction based on nonpayment of rent). If a court finds the landlord acted in retaliation for protected tenant activities and further finds that landlord would not otherwise have sought the eviction, the landlord may be prevented from evicting the tenant. If a landlord sues a tenant within six months of a tenant's filing a complaint to a government agency about the landlord's treatment of the tenant, the court will presume that the landlord is retaliating against the tenant for filing that complaint and the landlord must provide that he or she has a non - retaliatory motive for seeking to evict the tenant. Real Property Law § 223-b.
