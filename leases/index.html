<h2>Renting an Apartment</h2>
<p>When a tenant is looking for an apartment to rent, a potential landlord cannot refuse to rent that apartment to the tenant on the basis of his or her race, religion, color, national origin, sex, disability, or marital status. The landlord also cannot charge more than he or she would, or impose other conditions on the tenancy, because a particular tenant or the tenant's family on these grounds. This section will review some of these protections, as well as others, that protect a tenant when he or she is looking to rent an apartment.</p>

    <li><h3>Right Against Discrimination by Landlord or the Landlord's Agent <a href="http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYDATA=EXC296">Executive Law § 296(5)(a)</a></h3> <button> + </button>
        <p class="info" >
            A landlord cannot refuse to rent or discriminate against potential renters due to the renter's race, creed, color, national origin, sexual orientation, military status, sex, disability, or marital status. Whether the landlord or someone working for the landlord discriminates against you does not matter: it's still discrimination covered by the law. There are a limited number of buildings where these protections do not apply, however. For example, these protections do not apply to two-family homes where the owner of the building resides in one of the apartments in the home, to buildings where all of the rooms are rented to members of the same sex, the renting of a room in an apartment where the owner of the apartment also lives in the same apartment, to restrictions on sales or rental of housing where those restrictions prevent the sale of apartments to people exclusively over the age of 65, or to apartments where the residents are all 55 or older.

    <li><h3> Right to Nondiscrimination for Tenants With Children Real Property Law §§ <a href="http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYDATA=RPP236">236</a>, <a href="http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/LAWSSEAF.cgi?QUERYDATA=RPP237">237</a>. </h3><button> + </button>
        <p class="info" >
                A landlord who refuses to rent any or part of any residential premises solely on ground prospective tenant has children is subject to criminal and civil liability. There are exceptions to these limits as well. Apartments that are federally subsidized senior citizen housing, owner-occupied one- or two-family homes, or trailer parks for persons 55 or over.  In addition, any rental lease that provides during a lease term that the tenant shall not bear children is a violation of the law.

        <h3>Right to Nondiscrimination for Tenants with Disabilities</h3><button> + </button>
        <p class="info" >
                Landlords are required to provide reasonable accommodations for tenants with disabilities so that they may enjoy equal access to and use of housing accommodations. A "reasonable accommodation" is a policy or rule change that is related to a tenant's specific disability and does not impose extremely high costs on a landlord or cause harm or discomfort to other tenants. Such a reasonable accommodation might include permitting a tenant who is blind or has a psychiatric disability to have a guide dog or a companion animal despite a building's "no pets" policy.
<br>
<br>
Additionally, a landlord may not refuse to permit, at the expense of the disabled tenant, reasonable structural modifications of existing premises occupied by the tenant, if such modifications may be necessary to afford the tenant full use of the premises. Such modifications may include building a ramp or installing grab bars in the bathroom. However, the landlord may require the tenant to agree to restore the interior of the premises to the condition that existed before the modification.
<br>
<br>
Tenants with disabilities who need accommodations should notify their landlord and request the necessary accommodations. Though such a request is not required to be in writing, it is often helpful should any dispute arise about the landlord's obligation and whether the tenant gave notice to the landlord of the request for the modification. A landlord may request documentation from a health care professional attesting to the disability. A tenant with a disability who thinks a landlord has unreasonably refused a reasonable accommodation request should contact the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).

    <li><h3>Right to Nondiscrimination for Tenants With Pets</h3><button> + </button>
        <p class="info" >
            Tenants may keep pets in their apartments unless their lease specifically prohibits it. Landlords may be able to evict tenants who violate a lease provision prohibiting pets. In multiple dwellings in New York City and Westchester County, a no-pet lease clause is deemed waived where a tenant "openly and notoriously" kept a pet for at least three months and the owner of the building or the owner's agent had knowledge of this fact. However, this protection does not apply to public housing or where the animal causes damage, is a nuisance, or substantially interferes with other tenants.
            <br>
            <br>
            Tenants who are visually or hearing impaired are permitted to have guide dogs or service dogs regardless of a no-pet clause in their lease. Also, tenants with a chronic mental illness are permitted to have emotional assistance animals. NY Civil Rights Law § 47.

    <h2>RENT CHARGES</h2>
    <p>When an apartment is not rent regulated, a landlord is free to charge any rent agreed upon by the landlord and tenant. If the apartment is subject to rent regulation, the law sets the initial rent and subsequent rent increases. To find out if your apartment is protected by rent regulations that cover certain parts of New York State, click HERE. [Rent Regulation Q and A]</p>
    <p> Maximum rent increases for apartments such to the rent stabilization law are set each year by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board.</p>
